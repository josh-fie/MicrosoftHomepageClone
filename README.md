# MicrosoftHomepageClone

This project showcases a design clone of a snapshot of the Microsoft Homepage from 2022 combined with a snapshot of the homepage from April 2023 with very slight tweaks made to accomodate responsiveness across all sizes from small mobile devices to large screens.

To access the deployed version please follow: https://microsofthpclone.netlify.app

Links and search inputs do not return new pages or destinations as this is purely a design clone of the Microsoft Homepage and not the full site. There is scope to further develop the destination pages in future. However, the homepage slideshow, dropdowns, hidden search bar and back to top sticky button operate as they do on the real-life Microsoft homepage.
